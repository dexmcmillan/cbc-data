# CBC Data Analysis
A repository for Jupyter notebooks that analyze data for CBC News stories and visualizations.

About me: I'm an Associate Producer for CBC News, working currently in the Digital Graphics department. My job is to quickly and accurately understand, analyze, summarize and visualize datasets for stories rolling out on [CBCNews.ca](www.cbcnews.ca).

You can find many of my best visualizations on [my portfolio](http://dextermcmillan.com/), which I designed and built myself using Vue.js.

Naming convention for notebooks follows this pattern: **\[Date (YYYYMMDD) of creation\] \[SLUG/KEYWORD\]**
