"Hi, I retired in January. This meant for me a significant reduction I income, which magnified recently with the increase of prices. I used to have three meals a day and now I have to do two frugal meals. Taxes on housing are high and pressing on my purchase power, thus adding to the higher cost of food and clothing, never mind house repair or maintenance and personal care I am still able to manage without much medicines, but I am mindful that getting sick will be disastrous for me. I already started eating my savings and wonder how others not having enough savings will deal with this situation. If Canadian firms are selling arms, why not taxing them."
"I'm currently on social assistance, not where I would like to be at this given time. I have been applying to almost every job and place available, with no such luck yet! I receive $466 a month from social assistance for food and basic needs, but $66 of that goes to my rent. I have not been eating much because I would rather let my son eat and buying healthy food has been the worse struggle yet!! Chips and non healthy food is much cheaper to buy, although my son loves all fruit, vegetables and meats I just can't afford it!! It's very disappointing. Not to mention all my utilities are in disconnection notice status because I can only afford to pay so much so my son can eat!! I just don't know where else to turn for employment I've been actively searching for a job for over 4 months now. I do have a college certificate as a nursing assistant and I can't even get hired!"
"Hi my name is Keith Amerey, i am writing to you to explain my situation and others with disabilities i used to know, i tried writing to u several times and no replies back, i thought id try one more time, so 9 outta the 10 i used to know became homeless once Trudeau and the Liberal's cut everyone off all the sudden from covid relief, and me , and all 10 of the people i knew all voted for him which i regret , and i know they do to, cause i thought he cared when he came out with CERB CRB etc etc, elections happen, which i heard put a stop on any talks to help disabled Canadians, but we had faith , maybe eventually he wud do something for the people with disabilities, then he threw his corrupt elections , which i just heard from u guys put a stop on our benefit, i wasn’t joking when i said 9 outta the 10 people i knew are gone cause they became homeless cause Trudeau took away all benefits for vulnerable Canadians who definitely still needed something, me, i never thought id come down to, do put gas or food on my plate, or no lights this month, cause i live off of 400$ a month after rents paid,,,, where i live , i need a vehicle to get to my doctors appointments cause i lost my leg above my knee in 2013, so im still learning how to walk, i used to deliver pizzas but the gas prices would take away my tips, and basically working for nickels & dimes, we need something cause me being homeless is tic toc tic toc , and whats starting to really hurt, is the stress building up every month , cause every month feels like im playing Russian Roulette is this month i wont be able to pay my rent cause i starved cause i had to pay a bill and gas, or is this or is it that, the stress is starting to become poison to my body, i don’t want to end up like all 9 of those people that are homeless i used to know , and the other guy was lucky and raised his kids right , he couldn’t pay his bills anymore so his daughter took him in and is taking care of him now! Which honestly thats how my family and race were raised to do, my family took care of my parents till they passed, i think its cruel sending ur parents to a home especially if its one of those pathetic hurt n places we all been hearing about , leaving their parents to rot in some places? Theres no excuse, my mom god be with her had bad Dementia and him and his sister and the family toughed it out all the way till shr past , god be with her!!! Anyways so about this CDB benefit, it definitely is TOO LATE for the 9 people u used to know and i heard there are thousands more since the pandemic started , ohh yeah if the PC’s vote in someone who definitely isnt going to be another Harper , like that tool they last had in charge, he was nothing but a tool, and the guy before him too, and he or she has to be better then Trudeau and his witch looking right hand cheap girl Christie no good freeload i call her, never liked her, bottom line CBC, the government doesn’t come out with this benefit yesterday, not just me but many more will be homeless soon, we don’t just need help financially, we need better everything, especially for like better Prothetics equipment and programs or ACCESSIBILITY for a new computer leg or arm , all i qualify for is a wooden peg leg basically compared to my computer leg thst i have thats falling apart cause my warranty is up and i can’t afford a new one for $50,000, my insurance covered but all my insurance $ is gone cause i only got so much, which most of it went to medical , and the one they want to give me is not a computer leg so its like a bottom feeder of legs compared to mine, i can’t use it for everyday its too hard for me and i definitely can’t go work with it, it be nice if you guys could help us people with disabilities and air something about this to help me and Canadians with disabilities, thanks for hearing me !"
"Greetings. I am writing from Vancouver Island, where for the past ten years my husband and I have been living full time in a travel trailer. Lamentably, in 2012, every lending institution in (and out of) town denied us a mortgage for a house we bought in 1987. For a few years we borrowed through private mortgage brokers, but--not surprisingly--they turned out to be nothing but loan sharks, so we gave up on keeping the only house we'd ever owned--the only home our son had ever known. Our lives--up to that point--had been progressing swimmingly. We had a new baby, our ""own"" house, and my husband was able to build in our backyard a 500 square foot workshop, fitted with 6 skylights, so that he could work from home and help raise our son during those hours I was either at school or working at one of my businesses.

But life is fickle, and can be cruel as well as kind. In 1994, after experiencing an unspeakable ordeal combined with childhood PTSD, my fine mind disintegrated, and I was diagnosed with a serious illness. I was told I would probably never work again, that a full-time job was out of the question. Though I tried to fight back, I could not regain what had previously been on offer. Between 1994 and 2000, I was hospitalized 14 times. (My husband kept count; I was unable--unwilling-- to recall such details.) So the dream started dying then and there; since the diagnosis and its malevolent fallout, I have been unable to work regular full-time hours. Though I have two university degrees (both first-class and one Summa cum lauda) and had previously owned and managed two successful businesses , my illness wiped me off the map as a “productive” citizen. Believe me, I had my career-path laid out for me. I was in the final stages of entering a full-time position at a local university—everything looked rosy. I was about to begin my dream job, teaching Spanish and English language and literature. I would feel fulfilled; I would bring home a healthy salary; I would have benefits and a full retirement package. I would have everything that many of my friends still have, but in the end I have none of that. I am grateful to have my son and my husband in my life, whereas some folks are not so fortunate. However, as for my career, I could not control fate then (just as I cannot control fate now), so I succumbed to an illness which itself was brought about basically by an unjust legal system. Another personal tragedy--but that, as they say, is another story.

My spouse and I are now both disabled, supported only by our modest Canada Pensions. I look for work when and where I can, as we are living far, far beneath the “poverty line.” I constantly ask myself--where is the middle class? I was middle-class! I never expected to be anything but middle class. I did not expect to be fabulously wealthy, but then again I did not want such a life. Conversely, I did not expect (and certainly did not want!) to be ""poor"" either. Before Covid entered our reality, we had a somewhat-solution to our depressingly self- admitted “poverty.” To escape the crushing penny-pinching, we put our heads together to figure out how to lead a life more comfortable than what we can barely eke out in this relatively new Canadian reality. Because we cannot afford to heat our RV in the cold months, we would save enough money for plane-tickets and to store our travel trailer for six months. We would then avoid the winter and fly to warmer climes, & (most important) visit less expensive countries. Most people, upon hearing about our six months of sun, assume we have lots of money. No, I tell them, we simply made a plan, and you can, too. To be honest, it is a fulfilling life, as we continue to expand our life experiences, raising both our consciousness and our spirits while encountering new cultures. It keeps us young and inquiring. It allows us to maintain open minds. When we return every spring, I am constantly surprised at old friends becoming set in their ways, and not as curious as they were when younger. We are not ""running away"", but rather heading towards a richer, fuller life. Granted, as we age, we cannot do this forever. However, as long as we have no choice, this is our reality, so we embrace it.

For the winter of 2020/21, we (like most of the populace) could not leave Canada. We could not go anywhere. Unsurprisingly, during the 18 months between April 2020 and October 2021, we spent most of our small nest-egg of hard-won savings, money we had been trying to hang on to for future emergencies. Because at that time--the winter of 20/21-- so many Snowbirds could not travel south, all the RV parks on the Island were booked solid, and moreover at a price we would not have been able to afford anyway. Again, we were faced with crushing future costs. I suppose in most situations there is always a silver lining (though often paper-thin). At least, during Covid's reign, we were not alone in our insecurity and misery. Not terribly silvery lining--more of a bronze patina...

However, finally...a stroke of luck found us a site on an acreage near Cobble Hill, just as we had almost admitted defeat. (Remember I said Fate is fickle?) The monthly pad-rate was reasonable, so the rent costs and grocery bills were manageable. Nevertheless, between the spring of 2020 and the fall of 2021, we still spent 3/4 of our savings on propane for heating the trailer and gasoline for our truck, as the trailer site was located far from any bus stops and we had no choice but to drive to all shops, as well as to my weekly medical & pharmacy appointments.

Last October we left for Guatemala, so were relieved not to have to spend every dime of our savings--which we surely would have, had we stayed another consecutive winter. Although during our sojourn in Guatemala we both had run-ins with Covid19, we recovered. Had we been living in Canada while dealing with the Virus, I have no doubt we would have nothing left of our rapidly declining “nest-egg.” So we both got better over a two-month period, grateful for the warm weather and affordable housing & foodstuffs.

Upon arrival back in Canada at the beginning of April, we discovered that our truck—which we had stored on a Saanich acreage—had been invaded by rats, and moreover the seat covers and carpeting was covered with mold and mildew. As it turned out, the parking spot in the sun — which we had been promised by the property owner— had been switched to the deep shade near the woods. As the long-term parking-lot was not an officially registered business, we were not recompensed by ICBC for any damage. Our fault, of course, because we could not afford to park both the truck and our trailer at a registered storage lot. We had been counting on the goodwill of our fellow human, but he was just another scammer taking advantage of the desperate.

Then came the day when I had to replenish my medications. What a shock! I had to pay almost $200 on the spot for medicines which are not optional. I immediately called Fair (!) Pharmacare to investigate the absurdity of charging full price from impoverished senior citizens. I was told that — if you will— the line in the sand for full pharmaceutical coverage had been drawn at $30,000 for two married people sharing a dwelling. Had we been separated or divorced, we would be treated as individuals, and thus not charged the $900 deductible for my medications. To add insult to injury, because I had worked the Federal Elections last fall (to garner a few extra hundred dollars), I had made “too much money.” Indeed, we had exceeded that line in the sand, as my working had pushed our 2021 income to $30,768.21. What—I ask—is the point of working when I am only going to end up with less money due to the (rather random) cut-off point for full Pharmacare coverage?

I worked hard for five 25-hour days; anyone who knows Elections Canada knows that the remuneration is decent, but the work is stressful (particularly during a pandemic; masks on all day long), and certainly not sustainable. But this is work I can do well, and so for the last three Federal elections I gradually worked my way up. As a supervisor this time, my duties were many and varied, but I managed to get through it all, and felt good about myself for having done a good job, and for being able to bring home some much needed cash. But the Elections Canada cheque came and went, though by the time I received it we were already in Latin America-- staying in frugal hotels and buying most of our meals on the street or shopping at markets for home-cooking in the kitchen on the top floor of our low-budget hotel.

But all good things come to an end (though I don't know why that's the case for some and not others). Here we are back in the country of our birth. Now we find life here even more outrageously expensive than when we left last fall. I've mentioned a few major culture shocks already, so I don't really want to talk about the expense of cellphones, but I have to, as they are a necessity to our lifestyle. I paid $10 per month in Guatemala for the same (actually, better) service as I pay for here. In fact, I spent most of today on the blower with Koodo Mobile, trying to process the babble spewing from someone (somewhere) named Omar, trying to convince him he charged my husband's account twice (over $100) for my monthly pre-paid coverage. On and on it went, an absurd conversation going nowhere. The Royal Bank was no help either; in fact, the woman on the end of that line was certainly being paid more than poor Omar, so I expected more from her. As it stands, that complaint will have to go to the RCMP before anyone else will call a fraud a fraud. Ridiculous, the whole episode. As I said, I don't wish to discuss cellphone costs, particularly when I don't even know what it will eventually cost me, once (if?) this mess is sorted.

Then I start thinking about this country and the concept of Universality; it is either a Sacred Cow or the Elephant in the Room (or both), for I never hear it mentioned by anyone in media reportage or during Question Period. Why on Earth (never mind just Canada) should a multimillionaire receive the same Canada Retirement Pension as those below the ""Poverty Line?"" The monthly cheques sent to the wealthy probably pay for a few dinners out, or maybe a weekend getaway. And I cannot comprehend why Joe and Judy BigBucks are paying deductions similar to mine for medications--most of my meds are necessary simply to help keep me sane in a world gone mad. But then perhaps that's the plan--have the poor either killing themselves or killing each other so that what's left of our beautiful Blue Planet is reserved for the fortunate few. I am not crazy--oh no. I realized that a long time ago. I do not believe in conspiracy theories--but maybe I should for all the truth which isn't reaching the masses. We must revisit Universality, as it is no longer relevant. If we still had a middle class, well, I'm sure things would be different. But face it, folks, we've gone spinning through a time machine back to the Middle Ages when Seurs and their Serfs were the only 2 classes. Where are all you in this dichotomy?

As for groceries? This is a trick question, right? Of course we are eating less meat and fewer fresh vegetables and fruits. We are eating less of everything, and what we do purchase from grocery stores is based primarily on sales. We are driving less, even though (in order to afford our trailer site) we must live some serious distance from a bus stop. We do not eat in restaurants. I try to make interesting, nutritious balanced meals based on our meagre income. It is possible, but more choice would be welcome. Rice, beans and pulses can be varied, but also a tad boring. We are going out visiting less, thus must refrain from spending quality time with friends (as they—some in similar financial straights—must refrain from visiting as well). Yes, things could always be worse, but that is not the premise I grew up with when I considered myself lucky to be Canadian. So here is where mental/emotional health begins to suffer in a big way. As Covid has proven, depression becomes the reality when individuals spend too much time alone, without the support of their tribe. Thus, aside from shopping for food/gas/housing, we are now faced with shopping for doctors. If you are lucky to have a family practitioner, consider yourself to have won the lottery. So though Covid is basically beat, we are still isolating because--again-- we have no choice. So much of our problems are related to a lack of choice.

My husband and I are already working through the last of our savings because our pensions only allow for 6 months out of country, otherwise we lose the GIS (guaranteed income supplement). After a combined 90-plus years of paying all manner of taxes in this country (income/property/retail/etc.), I don’t understand why my husband and I cannot stay away (anywhere) as long as we’d like—because:

We simply cannot afford to live in Canada any more. Not in the winter; not in the summer. Not. At. All. Period."
"During the past two years we have bought less and less food due to cost. The past 6 months have seen the most increases in my opinion. Trying to feed a family of 4 with moderately healthy food is impossible with our budget of 800 per month (that's 50 per week per person).

I used to be able to buy enough and even get extra most times. Pre covid anything we needed (soap, bathroom tissue, pet supplies and stuff like that) all was part of groceries budget. Now all that comes out of our dwindling spending.

These corporations and market pricing is inhumane."
"Due to a brain tumor I have a very difficult time working.
Because of that I have had to go on social assistance.

My diet now consists of porridge, hard boiled eggs, and canned tuna.
I eat once per day and try to rotate so I don't get sick of anything.

I am trying to get healthy but my income and expenses won't allow me to buy the supplements, meat, and veggies I need.

Rock bottom has a basement and I'm not the only one in it!"
"So in Canada we pay some of the worlds highest prices already for cell phones/internet services, our gas is rising, our groceries are rising, our utilities are rising, all while keeping our wages the same....My husband and I work over 40 hours each and make around 95,000/year with 2 teenagers. Our bills are beginning to stack up, so is the debt. We do NOT travel outside the country at all. We are not alone in this, these rising costs ARE NOT ECONOMICALLY SUSTAINABLE. When people making decent incomes have to choose which bills to pay over putting gas in their car to be able to get to work or what food they can buy this week.....there's a serious problem."
"I'm not rich, but I have a decent job and I'm mortgage free. But I am saving for retirement (which is soon), and I'm cutting back on my groceries. I look for sale items, look for the ""30% off"" in the meat section as you can freeze it...and anything else that will save me a little money...and that includes no-name rather than brand names. I'd rather choose to skip meals now than have no choice later."
"I am deeply disappointed about both gov'ts (Trudeau and Ford) ignoring the disabled. Peter Julian and Jagmeet Singh have shamed Trudeau about this many times as far back as the beginning of the pandemic. Ford was asked about this multiple times too and back in Sept. 2020 he said he was going to look into it. <crickets>
 
Chrystia Freeland announced she was working on a DIsability Benefit just before the snap election and then it was never mentioned again. It wasn't even in Trudeau's new budget. People are talking about a Basic Income, saying the $20,000 covid relief package they tried to live on through the pandemic was well below poverty. Try living on about $1,000 a month.
 
I am on ODSP and I barely make ends meet. Since the pandemic, I have had extra expenses like buying an air purifier, masks, disinfectants, limiting the # of stores I go to and missing out on some sales to try to be safer. I am immunocompromised and should not have been going out but I have no money for grocery deliveries or those services that shop for you. Every time the virus seems to subside a new variant comes along. I am more afraid now than at the beginning, even though I've had my booster and am awaiting my next one scheduled for June 13. People not required to wear masks or socially distance is really a threat to the most vulnerable. There's already talk of another booster this fall. It sounds like this is the new norm.
 
Trudeau has offered no covid relief to the non-working disabled. I also think he short-changed seniors by giving them a one time payment (3 months late), which wouldn't have gone far if they started getting grocery deliveries. Now with inflation rising, I will be broke next month and don't know if I will be able to meet my upcoming bills.
 
I can count on one hand how many times I've gone out for groceries in 2022. I only go out for groceries and jabs since the pandemic hit and living alone and not having anyone over, it's a very lonely existence. We feel like the forgotten ones.
 
Months ago, I have reached out to Julian, Singh and even your colleague Evan Solomon (to bring this up on his show) and have not gotten any responses. We've had petitions ignored. We were hurting before but now we are in crisis mode.
 
I don't believe the campaign promises because they haven't done anything already while in power and if there's something I've been made fully aware of watching the daily briefings is how easily Trudeau and Ford lie, even when they are caught."
"I read an article of yours recently with a question at the bottom of 'How has inflation and the high cost of living impacted you?' So, I thought send off my story thoughts are that it might be a good thing to do.
***********
I am a resident of Burlington with four kids ages: 15(daughter on the spectrum), 13,13,11. I am a writer/author of short fiction, Novellas and a children's book. The kids' dad works in the auto industry.
Thoughts take me back to when I was a teenager myself... my dad who has passed away two years ago in October, of colorectal rectal cancer was a clam digger. He worked until he got diagnosed. The year I graduated-- his income gross was 9k. My mother wasn't working at that time. We still had a place. and food in our bellies. I am a millennial, who has a higher income than my parents did...I just happen to be miles poorer.
My kids were learning virtually at home during the first pandemic year. Writing became hard, with that being said it helped with my PTSD and depression. The PTSD was from trauma from years past. Unknowns can be especially difficult for those of us that suffer with this. Unknowns were/still plentiful during this time in history. Writing was and is good for my mental health. Ultimately, we had a roof over our heads, we had each other, that brought a level of comfort. One I thought couldn't be bought.
The auto industry took a big hit with part shortages. Money was the tightest it has ever been, we got through it nonetheless. That may have meant putting off bills to put food on the table sometimes. That may have meant forgoing extras, this was a no brainer for us though. Kids having their necessities (warmth, food, housing) was our greatest concern. Their mental health stayed intact, most importantly. We have often been told our kids are some of the best, kindest, most positive kids ever. They appreciate the little things... you see, we've never had a lot. I've just always taught them to be thankful for what we do have, all the same.
I've dropped food off to those that were in need over the last couple years. I helped with other people's kids Christmas presents. As hard as I thought I had it I knew on the most basic of common sense levels that there were people that had it harder, that they were struggling more.
The ""C"" word is a recurrent issue of mine, Cervical. This both came back and worsened during the overwhelming of the hospitals. It is something that finally got looked after in November. I felt lucky to be alive, I thought this family finally made it through the storm, another shot at being the best mom I could within this mess of inflation and high costs of living. Besides, I always managed... surely, I'd be able to continue just that.
March came. I had gone to Toronto for the night. Lowering of numbers and my immunizations meant a very-rare-free staycation was possible. I was told, upon my arrival back home, that the landlord wanted to come over to take pictures in a few days. That this was a ""non-negotiable"" request. Panic replaced saliva in my throat. I thought the worst. Were they going to sell? Where would I go if that were to ever happen? I had resided in this quad complex for 16 years. All my children were born/brought home here. This was the safest I had ever felt in my whole adult life. Friends and family tried to reassure me: ""Just take it one day at a time, maybe it is nothing..."" But I was rightfully terrified.
Photographer came by took pictures of all rooms. My daughter, who is the last of my children to be virtual learning, and myself toiled for three days cleaning it to the best of our ability. I had almost convinced myself that maybe-- certainly this was because the landlord was going to do some much-needed repairs, the latest tide of COVID infections was receding, that this place is in some substantial fixing, that's what was happening quite likely, right? The landlord did not step foot in my unit, we were not told what this was about. I saw that she was standing outside. I haphazardly put on my kids shoes and headed outside to find out why this was all happening.
Finding common ground has always been my strong suit, I like people. It may be the Bluenoser in me, I'm positive it is, even though I've lived in this province for 17 years total. I hadn't seen her in well over a decade. Time to rip off that Band-Aid. Outside I went...
""So, how have your four been?"" Awkward maybe, but she smiled, this would be the only time.
""Oh, they've been great, how about yo—""
I couldn't wait, small talk I could no longer do. I just spat it out. ""So, what is happening here?""
Worst fear came to fruition when she told me that: It was time. Translation, it was time for her to sell. A lot became foggy after that. I broke down, I asked what would become of this place. Would I be able to rent from the new owners? She has reassured me that it may not even sell, maybe she'd change her mind and not do it at all. ""We'll figure this out"". I stated that we'd be homeless in this market making less than 5k a month. The response was ""I have no control over what the new owners may, or may not do...""
A short time after this 4-unit building sold. A week or two perhaps, it sold without a sign on the lawn. It went for 2.4 million, it was built in 1960's... the realization that all four families, all with children, all hardworking families of this quad unit would be without a home. After talking to my neighbours is was quickly made known that none of us made enough for a roof over their heads in this market.
An N12 came shortly after a one-time, unannounced-by-landlord walkthrough. The agent had to translate to the buyers, they didn't understand English. I had been asked by the buyer, translated through the agent: How much do you pay a month here? I answered. The response wasn't understood by me. Why would that be important? If the buyer, a spouse and a spouse's parent was moving into this 12 bedroom, 4-unit quad?
Nevertheless, now I turned into a harmattan of panic. I contacted Doug Ford's office, Housing help, HATCH (the waiting list I've read is 7-12 years long), several homeless shelters, Burlington's MP. Tried to find another source of income. And I heard back from all. They have all sent links for food banks, given the website to the LTB, they gave me numbers for distress lines, they will tell you to apply for subsidized housing. Even though you're not told that this list is one that is years long. Nobody can help with housing. ""Everyone is having a hard time right now.""
What is the good of food bank numbers and locations if you have no home to prepare meals in?
Don't look for empathy on social media, if you're looking for advice, stay away. I've been told by the baby boomer generation that: ""Millennials, they are lazy, if they worked harder, they'd have houses like we did."" Record inflation and cost of living has cemented that this dream remains just that. We work hard, we raise kids during a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, our mental health has been obliterated but that gets boiled down to the word ""lazy"". We put bills off, that have in turn, ruined our credit just to put food on the table. To buy gas to keep our jobs to be able to drive to...
My wish is for politicians of all stripes to see the catastrophe that occurring behind purposefully clouded eyes. Housing needs to be a right.
Landlords, if you can compensate your tenants, please do that. Sixteen years I've paid my rent-on time, we owe them nothing. Kept property damage-free for the entirety of our living here. We have been given until June 30th to be out. I have been threatened. Told locks will be changed the day of, that a Sherriff will remove us. We have five hundred in the bank. Every house is 3000 a month. Nobody will consider us, especially with bad credit.
Our daughter who is on the spectrum needs schedules and predictability. How am I to give that to her? Why is that only awarded to the high-income earners?
I'm doing my best to help out my neighbours, the ones that also have to move, possibly share with them their rights as tenants. Some have a less-than-perfect understanding of English . I'll continue to try. Panic attacks and sleepless nights remain. Where will we all go?
What kind of future will be awaiting the children of Canada?
Cost of living and inflation will be catastrophic for so many families. I fear this is just the tip of the iceberg. There is at least four families in this boat in unknown waters with me.
I completely agree that landlords have a right to sell their property at whatever cost they see fit. We'd still all like to know, nevertheless, who cares about us, the displaced people. I fear the worst-case scenario of the trauma in our society is playing out in technicolour right before our eyes online daily. The poor, the disempowered, the desperate, the feeble and the weak are looked at as less-than. Stereotyped and labelled as the ones that didn't try enough, the ones that were too lazy to work. Which couldn't be further removed from the truth. Nobody in this complex is looking for hand-outs.
Some of us barely kept our heads above the water during the pandemic, but we still managed somehow. Empathy doesn't cost a thing yet it just seems to be a supply issue as well these days.
Another abnormal test, I just recently received word of it. I can't focus on that right now. My kids still need a home, this has to come first.
Comfort, safety and predictability does cost after all, and it's a goddamned shame that this is the case. This is the thing that should concern every Canadian. No one should have to make the choice between health, shelter and food. A low income doesn't mean we aren't worthy of humannesses.
Thanks for reading my email,"
"In regards to inflation and just a general malaise of the population as a whole, difficult decisions ARE being made and HAVE to be made.
Do I buy groceries or do I pay my outrageous light bill? Do I pay all of my rent or just a partial payment and get my prescription drugs to help remove the blood clots caused by me having cancer? ( I do have blood clots, by the way.)
The govt. says to eat healthy but it's a hell of a lot easier to eat UNhealthy. Compare the price of fresh fruit to a bag of potato chips.
Compare the price of a 2 litre of milk to a 2 litre of pepsi.
Here's something for the CBC to check on - - Go around to various food banks and talk to the people in charge. Compare the number to what it was 2 or 3 years ago. It's going to shock you. Talk to taxi drivers (NOT the stand owners or the office managers),
ask the drivers how many hours they work, how much goes in the tank and how much goes in their pockets at the end of a 12 or 14 hour shift.
I said to my wife, if I were 20 years younger, I'd have a class 1 air brake and a ticket to Alberta. I really CANNOT see a future back here in this province. Oh, before I go, can someone tell me when the Carbon tax is going to kick and how much it's going to be? I've heard 16 to 20 cents PER LITRE!!
As far as our govt. ""leaders"" go, they really need to take their holistic heads out of their holistic asses and step
into the real world. I really don't think that Stephen King could imagine some of the bull sh!t that's going on in
this province."
"I’m a 19 year old college student and these gas prices have really made an impact on me, can barely afford to put gas in my car to get myself to school and work, have no transit routes even near me unless I want to walk an hour to the bus stop. Even the price of living. My dream was to move out and live on my own, how am I able to do that with rent being close to 2,000$ a month with no utilities included? and our hourly wages no reflecting on the inflation of groceries and apartments/hours? I’ve been angry for a while now but I’ve told myself “it’ll get better. It’s just because of pandemic, it’s just a rough spot” but now we see no light at the end of this god awful tunnel. To afford to live I went to college, now to afford college I’m working 2 jobs, now with the price of gas I have no social life anymore. How is this the life… how is this what people dream of… it’s not and it’s gotten ridiculous but who am I to talk to? Our prime minister won’t listen to us. Leaders are always about “wanting to help the public” then find a solution because you’re bring your people to poverty, homelessness and some serious health and mental health issues."
"Could you please let Merrilee Fullerton know it's called the ""Ontario"" Disability Support Program NOT the ""Canadian"" Disability Support Program.
She needs to take accountability and not pawn it off on the federal government. 
There are almost 400.000 people on ODSP, We haven't had an increase since 2018. The cost of living in Ontario has risen dramatically over the last 3 years. A couple receives a maximum of $781 a month for rent while the average rent for a 1 bedroom apt. is nearly twice that much. We have to use money from our Basic Needs portion to help pay for rent which leaves us with little money for food and other necessities. 
The ODSP rates need to increase by 80%. We are living in squalor, eating unhealthy food and not able to buy clothes or shoes. People with disabilities have enough to deal with in coping with their disabilities, our survival should not take precedents over our disabilities.
The Conservative government of Ontario has hung us out to dry over the last 3+ years. We only represent 3% of the population so we don't really matter. What if Fullerton or Ford had a niece or nephew on ODSP trying to survive on $1,169 a month...probably not, or things would change. 
We are the most vulnerable and helpless 400,000 people of Ontario who are being ignored like we are lepers. This cannot continue. We want to LIVE, not survive."
"While watching videos on facebooking came across a video of a girl who has to give up her job at the Regent Mall due to the price of gas.
Thought this might e news worthy. I will try to send the video."
"This is a serious problem, but there is little notice that the consumer is not getting a pay increase to compensate. I am a senior with a fixed pension and cannot afford to eat properly."
"I am a survivor of Historical Sexual Abuse. I have been on ODSP since I was 30. Until then I worked full time. I have C-PTSD, PTSD, Medication Resistant Depression, Chronic Anxiety etc. I can't work, but wish I could. Everything has skyrocketed in prices except for disability amounts. Food? Who can afford to eat? I live above a friends garage. I am 53, and I am strongly considering MAID. I don't want to live like this anymore. I struggle mentally every day to survive, and now I can't even afford food. I would love people that are able to work, to ask themselves, how they would be able to survive on a little over 1,000 a month? They couldn't. I have the same illnesses as Naomi Judd. I have tried everything. Every kind of treatment, sometimes several times. When your government doesn't care if you have a roof over your head, or food in your stomach?? What else is left? Especially when you struggle mentally and physically to survive as it is. I was a Dancer, Singer, Model and Hairstylist. I have a lot going for me, just as Naomi Judd did. I don't feel that I have anything left. I can't even afford therapy.
Contact me anytime that you like. I would gladly be a voice."
I have been on disability from work since November 2019. Making 60% of my previous work Income has been difficult because the bills have not gone down. The steadily increasing costs have eaten into and eliminated any discretionary spending. I looked into applying for my cpp early but found out that if I took my cpp to try to make my situation better my insurance company (Canada life) will deduct any amount dollar for dollar. I don't understand why they can legally take something that I PAID for so that they can stop paying me for the disability benefits that I paid them for. Then they told me that I had to apply for cpp disability or be cut off. My application was recently approved by cpp disability so now their profits will increase while my situation continues to deteriorate even though I paid for both . Please contact me for further information. I am sure that I am NOT the only Canadian in this situation.

"How it's affected us....work days we eat mainly one meal per day and that is either lunch or dinner. Weekends just one main meal middle of the day
Sometimes sacrifice nutrition over cheaper versions. Instead of paying 6 or 7 dollars for a small bag of potatoes, we buy a box of instant potatoes. Bypass roasts, steak, chicken. Substitute with hotdogs or bologna when on sale. Had a 1% raise a couple of years ago to keep up with inflation...1% is a joke Feel bad for seniors. It will definitely take a toll on their health making their lives much shorter. With gas prices so high its getting harder just to afford going to work. This is nothing more than corporate greed, not fallout from covid and wars. They just latched onto that as an excuse to cover up their gouging. Very sad. We are going backwards in time instead of forward. I can see where this is headed down the road. No last names please and thanks"
Why are seniors never mentioned having difficulty eating? There incomes don't go up. Most seniors 70 and up cannot work for many reasons. Young people can work and jobs are available. The rising cost of living is affecting senior many have to go to food bank to eat which is probably the first time in there lives. Sad but true.
"You are talking as if you are not from Canada. ARE YOU AN ALIEN 👽.

"Would like to know why there is no increase from the government on cpp.they say they are helping by giving to organizations that are supposed to be helping us.We do not need this so called help from these organizations we need an increase in our pensions.people are struggling from inflation but we are on a fixed income the only seniors getting anything are those above 75. We are all seniors at 65+ we also need help but were is it.it (https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/8YEBCYMnnFVz997I0qNRS?domain=it.it) seems like we are forgotten by all government.i have sent several emails to various MPs with absolutely no response except for the standard reply that they are concerned about us.
It is extremely frustrating that no one cares."
"In response to inflation which is a tax increase on all Canadians.

My family no longer eat out and we have returned to cooking our own food.

Also we have have planted a garden."
"Hello,

I saw the article about economizing at the grocery stores. There is one practice that I really don't like that is done at Superstore (less so at non-Lowlaws stores). It bothers me so much that I leave the store upset and make an effort to not shop there anymore.

There seem to be a lot 2 fors popping up in the aisles. I don't like them because they are targeting the food insecure people. If someone has a tight budget, they may not be able to buy 2 of everything to get the deals (least half the products at Superstore are like that). So the 2 for $7 or $4.49 each now costs that person $1 more for that item. Add that up over a grocery cart and the extra cost can be significant.
There is also the issue that not everyone has a place to keep or store the extra items. If you're in a small apartment or house you may not room so you can't take advantage of those savings.
Carrying all of the items may be difficult if you walk or take public transit. I couldn't walk home with 3 bottles of distilled water which I need to buy to get the ""deal"".
I understand pricing like this has always occurred in having the unit price of larger packaging being cheaper. But at least the argument there could be that there is actually a savings due to reduced packaging, handling, etc. In a climate where we shouldn't be hoarding or wasting food, we shouldn't feel forced to buy more than we need. It feels like the disadvantaged at a disadvantage yet again. I've emailed Superstore about it and got a lovely, ""we try to keep prices low"" non-answer."
"All this talk about price rises, and how it is affecting the working people. But what about us seniors? Who speaks for us. Have you or others really checked to see how little we get a month. O.A.S is a joke at just over $600 a month and CPP isn't much better. Some qualify for an Income supplement. But in truth the Government has never really given us pensions/OAS increases more than 1or 1.3%... far short of a cost of living rise! Please don't forget us"
"Not to minimize the (perfectly genuine) strain caused by inflation, but in order to address a real problem, a real solution is needed. When it comes to grocery purchases, that includes an accurate sense of what constitutes a healthy, sustainable diet … and consumer comments I’ve see on the CBC (and elsewhere) suggest the very uninformed view that buying less meat necessarily means having a less healthy diet.

I *don’t* mean to say that no meat at all is advisable, but for *years* (for example) we’ve known that a piece of steak about the size of a deck of cards is appropriate for an adult. Such long-recommended dietary changes may not be welcome, and may esp be unwelcome when forced by economic circumstances, but that whole difficult process would still be easier if people had an accurate understanding.

So, it might be helpful for CBC to report on *how people are using well-founded medical insights* to negotiate grocery buying decisions."
"I was in the food to doing my shopping like myself on old age I seen this woman who is on old age pen going up and down the isle looking for the sales same as me.
when I seen her stop at the pet isle knowing this woman which I will not name she did not have a dog I watched her put in dog food such a stew type dog food
I kund of stuck up a conversation with her on diiffernts things she said to me this is pretty sad when you can not a ford to eat and pay bills I see there talking about increasing child benefits and what
not but I never see our old age pen go up out other then the $500 hundred they gave us as a one time deal.I was just wondering why rent food and gas went up why is our old age not go up so we and other like this older lady can buy food just a question"
"People that just get by on pensions have no choice but to cut back on food,medication and other necessities."
I live in Kimberley BC. Theres no transit. How many Canadians outside the cities are stuck? Its getting so I cant even afford to drive to Walmart or Superstore to save money on groceries. Its a 68 k round trip at highway speeds. I live on CPP OAS GIS.
Pay Rent Or Buy Groceries? The choice is groceries. You wouldn't survive long if you don't eat food.
"Don't these people realize inflation is at an all time high and that many are already struggling in this province? A 10% increase will be disastrous to many especially those on fixed incomes who already have to make tough decisions between food, prescriptions and yes even heating. This is not the time for another increase, period."
